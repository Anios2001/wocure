It is abundantly clear above that despite government's strong action against Women Related Crimes, they are still taking place at an unregulated pace. The problem becomes serious in a small town with low network coverage, making it easy for the perpatuators to indulge in such activities. Police Department's inoovative CCTNS and Crime Database solution fails to address the problems of Local Women because of a huge uncertainty in the occurence of such events as most of the accused are not history sheeters. Dealing with the issue requires an holistic and proactive approach which can use real time data to take action quickly, resulting in decreasing the extent of harm to the victim or even stopping the accused to commit such henious acts.

The problem would become unstoppable if an constructive action is not taken and it would become extremely difficult to curb these activities in the future. So, the time is ripe to start making a system so robust and reliable so that WOMEN in India can go anywhere in the country without being fearful of the consequences. Government's Ministry of Human Affairs has done a commendable job in eradicating such activities in urban areas, they have also launched various initiatives to encourage effective solutions from the college students.

One of the inovative initiative from the ministry was to start Hackahtons focussing on redressal of the same problem using IT Resources. We took part in Smart India Hackathon 2020 and succeeded in creating a safe environment for Women by using a strong IT Infrastructure to respond quickly, effectively and reliably when any such incident occurs.

## DETAILED ANALYSIS
A naive and non-technical solution to above problem is that women should not go to silent places in order to stop these acts and the general concensus supports and follows this idea. Moreover, restricting Women in this ever growing world would be unethical and can impact career oppurtunities for women. So a solution is needed so that Women can feel safe in any environment alone.
## TECHNICAL STACK
We were in a need of a platform which is easily available to buy and cheap in order to solve this problem for a large audience. So we decided to develop an application for the Android Platform. To develop the app we used following technical resorces:
1. ANDROID STUDIO 4.8
2. ADOBE XD
3. MYSQL
4. SQLite
5. Android Thread API
6. FIREBASE REAL TIME DATABASE
7. GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION
8. FACEBOOK AUTHENTICATION
9. GeoLocation API
10. Graph APIs
11. Azure ML
At the backend we required a server which could transfer the real time requests to the desired Police Database and relative's Mobile Phones. We decided to with Nginx Server implemented using React.js library. Folllowing is the backend tech stack:
1. React.js
2. Nginx Server
3. GraphQL
4. SQL
5. Azure Load Balancer
6. Azure Compute Instance
7. Azure ML
The Police End of the application moves to implement an another android application through which the reddressal can be robust across a Police Department and quick enough to address the request by a victim in 5mins.
1. ANDROID STUDIO 5.1
2. ADOBE XD
3. MYSQL
4. Police Auth Service API
5. Geolocation API
6. NCRB Database API
7. Azure ML
8. Azure Big data Computation
9. Graph APIs
10. Mockito Random Data Generator
11. Mockaroo API Mocking tool
