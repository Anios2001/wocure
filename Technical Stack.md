# Firebase
For the backend, I used Firebase RealTime Database to save the location quickly on the database and retrieve it quickly on the other hand.
Because of the NoSql structure of the data base, queries were easy to write and fast. 
Whenever I need to get the data, it was right there.
As Firebase is a industry recognised service developed by google, it enforces strict security rules in the database infrastructure.

# Google Maps API
Because a use case of my application was to get the real time location, I exploited GOOGLE's API for this task.
This API needs only the latitude and longitudes in order to shift the Camera to the specific position.

# Background Trigger Recievers  
These triggers were for registering the 3 presses of the mobile phone.
